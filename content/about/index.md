Hello, Friend!

My name is Aleks and I am a Web Developer. I'm 24, from Latvia, residing in London, UK (<em>Beer's great here, weather - no so much, but you will get used to it if you come around</em>).

Writing <code>code</code> is not something that I thought I would ever do with such a great enthusiasm. My background is hospitality industry. One day (almost 2.5 years ago) everything changed and I left that field, but this is the story for another time.

What is important - is today. And today I can honestly say: "I love what I do". I love writing code and see it working. Then making this code more elegant. Then make it sexy. Then repeat.

In March 2016 I have quit my full-time job as an SEO and dedicated myself to learning how to code and most importantly, how to think like a programmer. In April 2016 I have enrolled in the online coding bootcamp - <a href="http://thefirehoseproject.com">The Firehose Project</a>, which I have completed at the end of August.

I have blogged about my progress and things that I have learned on the course and outside of it every week. Feel free to follow along my journey starting at <a href="http://localhost/firehose-project-week-1/">Week 1</a>.

I have also built a <a href="https://aleksgorbenko.github.io">portfolio website</a> where you can see most of the projects that I have built.

As my bootcamp journey came to an end, the new and challenging one is ahead of me - the job hunt. Right now, I am in the active stage of looking for Junior Developer positions in London. If you happen to recruit Junior and know somebody who does - please get in touch.

May the Force be with you,

Aleks
