      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I got the first taste of JavaScript language and pretty much the whole week was spent in it. I barely touched Ruby or Rails. While I have worked with JS before a little as I watching Lynda.com&amp;rsquo;s Programming Fundamentals course, it was not until now that I have tried to solve challenges with it and not following the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week I mainly was jumping around between three learning resources for JS: Firehose JS Deep Dive, FreeCodeCamp and an app - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sololearn.com/&#34;&gt;SoloLearn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
