      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have all heard this advice. &amp;ldquo;Follow your passion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably a few years ago I would totally support such advice and be an advocate of the &amp;ldquo;find your passion&amp;rdquo; movement. Not until I have actually lost the direction of where I was going and all my plans basically went to dust. Passion was lost without a sign.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I thought &amp;ldquo;ok, I just need to find it again&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was the moment when I realised I have no idea how to do it or where to even start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been lost? I mean lost mentally and emotionally? Lost direction in your life, your purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did it occur to you when you wake up one day in the morning and you wonder: &amp;ldquo;What the hell is going on?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What the hell I was doing for the last 6 months, a year, 5 years?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Why I was doing it?&amp;rdquo; And you don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer for any of these questions. There is nothing wrong with your memory, you remember it all, but it all seems not right anymore, not familiar to you. You start losing the grip of who you are and what you do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Most Valuable Currency In the World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You remember that movie &amp;ldquo;In Time&amp;rdquo; with Justin Timberlake running around the block? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great movie at all, but there was one good line:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is now the currency.&#xA;- Will Salas (played by Justin)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He is wrong. It has been always the one and single currency. We as humans have invented the concept of time and gave it a subjective measurement. From then on we use time as currency even if we are not aware of it. Think about it. For every day of life we &amp;ldquo;pay&amp;rdquo; 24h of our time. And funny enough, the wealth of time comes to us by the default on day 1, when we are born. Unlike the monetary wealth which most of us spend most of our time chasing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
