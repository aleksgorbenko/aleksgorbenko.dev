      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coding bootcamps are not easy. Finding the job after one is often even harder. I spent a total of 3 months looking for a position since I have finished mine. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331#.xo8qlsw5f&#34;&gt;There is a similar post written recently&lt;/a&gt; and I have been meaning to write about my experiences as well after I get the job. I got one so I want to share my angle and what I have learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned the previous week, I am getting closer to the point where I will have to start the job search so I have started to work on my portfolio website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-jekyll&#34;&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to use Jekyll to build it and host it on GitHub Pages. Firstly, deployment is as simple as just making a git commit and pushing the code to GitHub. You just have to make sure that the repo is named correctly: &amp;lsquo;&lt;code&gt;marcusaurelius.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Secondly, it is totally free. Jekyll was developed by GitHub team, so the only thing that you have to learn is the Jekyll itself, the rest will be taken by GH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
