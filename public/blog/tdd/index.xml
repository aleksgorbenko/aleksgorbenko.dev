      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 4rth app that was developed using TDD - &lt;a href=&#34;https://grammable-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;Grammable&lt;/a&gt;. It is quite simple (the app, not the process), yet it is much more professional (in the back-end) than other apps that I have built in a sense that it employs industry best practices (as any app should, as it turns out).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I have quite a lot of algorithm tasks to solve and I really felt that it was the area that I needed to work on as I kind of neglected it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
