      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coding bootcamps are not easy. Finding the job after one is often even harder. I spent a total of 3 months looking for a position since I have finished mine. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331#.xo8qlsw5f&#34;&gt;There is a similar post written recently&lt;/a&gt; and I have been meaning to write about my experiences as well after I get the job. I got one so I want to share my angle and what I have learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Firehose Project Week 12</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned the previous week, I am getting closer to the point where I will have to start the job search so I have started to work on my portfolio website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-jekyll&#34;&gt;Enter Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to use Jekyll to build it and host it on GitHub Pages. Firstly, deployment is as simple as just making a git commit and pushing the code to GitHub. You just have to make sure that the repo is named correctly: &amp;lsquo;&lt;code&gt;marcusaurelius.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Secondly, it is totally free. Jekyll was developed by GitHub team, so the only thing that you have to learn is the Jekyll itself, the rest will be taken by GH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, the jQuery actually makes more sense now. I have spent this week reading up on it and finished a couple of courses as well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jquery-fundamentals&#34;&gt;One on Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt; and another one &lt;a href=&#34;http://jqexercise.droppages.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(update: it is offline now, so try &lt;a href=&#34;http://try.jquery.com/&#34;&gt;this instead&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. The latter is very practical as it basically asks you to do something with jQuery and gives you 300 seconds to figure out how to do it. Each task makes you google, come back and try your solution, repeat if not working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As planned, this week I spent learning more of the JavaScript (nope, I still don&amp;rsquo;t like it that much).  I have also watched some Plularsight.com courses, and spent time working on the group project, chatting with the team about the tasks we need to complete helping each other with ideas along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two main areas I tried to concentrate on this week was the this keyword and the Prototypical Inheritance in JS. I know you can write class-like code in ES6 (which is a relief actually), but in any case to really understand how objects are created in JS and how they inherit methods and properties from each other one has to go through PI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week my single attention was devoted to JavaScript. I have managed to do quite a few things and can definitely say that I am feeling more confident. Firstly I have built another app - &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;ToDo&lt;/a&gt; with Rails and jQuery. Many things were not exactly clear to me while I was writing code, so I decided to start over and found some additional sources to learn JS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://watchandcode.com/&#34;&gt;WatchAndCode.com&lt;/a&gt;, made by Gordon Zhu, ex-Googler. The course is totally free and it is not yet finished, he is releasing modules every week. Funny enough the app that you build as you go along is the&amp;hellip;Todo app :) The only difference is that he uses only JS, no other frameworks or languages. The first 40% I could easily skip, but everything that came after I found incredibly useful. Moreover, I started getting jQuery concepts that were eluding me before. I understood finally the difference between the Event Listeners and Event Handlers. I have learned what is a Callback and Higher Order Function. Gordon has a very rare skill of explaining things simply so if you think you are &amp;ldquo;not getting&amp;rdquo; - try &lt;a href=&#34;https://watchandcode.com/&#34;&gt;his course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 4rth app that was developed using TDD - &lt;a href=&#34;https://grammable-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;Grammable&lt;/a&gt;. It is quite simple (the app, not the process), yet it is much more professional (in the back-end) than other apps that I have built in a sense that it employs industry best practices (as any app should, as it turns out).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I have quite a lot of algorithm tasks to solve and I really felt that it was the area that I needed to work on as I kind of neglected it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made some more progress with the 3rd project - &lt;a href=&#34;http://flixter-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;Flixter&lt;/a&gt; app &lt;em&gt;(Update 09.06.16: it is now finished).&lt;/em&gt; I deviated a bit from the original design just to experiment a bit more with Bootstrap and practice design skills in general, so I spent longer time playing with these things this week. Apart from that following the tradition I made a ton of mistakes and spent lots of time for solving them :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I kept my main focus on JavaScript, although I did start the third application on the Firehose course - Flixter. It is not live yet and I will aim to complete it within the 2 - 2.5 weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went through a course of some new GitHub techniques like branching, stashing and merging as well as resolving the merge conflicts. At this stage while I am not in a dev team I don&amp;rsquo;t really use them, but I am sure as my apps become more sophisticated, but most likely I will experience that when I start working on the team project after few more weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I got the first taste of JavaScript language and pretty much the whole week was spent in it. I barely touched Ruby or Rails. While I have worked with JS before a little as I watching Lynda.com&amp;rsquo;s Programming Fundamentals course, it was not until now that I have tried to solve challenges with it and not following the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week I mainly was jumping around between three learning resources for JS: Firehose JS Deep Dive, FreeCodeCamp and an app - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sololearn.com/&#34;&gt;SoloLearn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I have finished the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nomster-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;Nomster&lt;/a&gt; application that &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/firehose-project-week-2/&#34;&gt;I have started the previous week&lt;/a&gt;, but before I go into that I will cover the most significant lesson that I have learned in the past week&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-overload-yourself&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Overload Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lots of boot camps have a crazy schedule where you are studying for 10-12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. I thought that this is the way to succeed so I have tried to recreate the same atmosphere for myself at home while studying online. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the peer pressure as well as I don&amp;rsquo;t have others to rely upon in case I am really stuck (of course, there is the Slack channel, but it&amp;rsquo;s a different sort of help from the one that you can get from another student who sits right next to you at the desk), so I was aware that I will have to push myself a lot. So I did. It worked out at the start, but this week I had to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week passed even faster than the previous one. I studied pretty much every day and learn new concept as well. The very basics of the application building were laid in the first week, now it was time to practice them and build upon more foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started off this week with building the 2nd application called Nomster - a review site. As students of Firehose Project, we are free to choose which type of places we want to review. It had to be a physical place as part fo the project is to use Google Maps API. As I am based in London and I am Russian, born in Latvia - I decided to make a review site Russian and Eastern European restaurants and food shops in London.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week of the boot camp is completed and so far it has been nothing but great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the week is the fact that I have built my first application and deployed it to Heroku. It is live and available here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://splurty-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;http://splurty-aleks-gorbenko.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a simple quote generator where you can submit your quote, and it would spit out a random quote to the homepage every time someone visits or refreshes it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-accidental-email&#34;&gt;An Accidental Email&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last couple of weeks I have spent researching the boot camps without actually planning to do so. While I have done that already before and had my eyes on Viking Code School for several months now (as you can probably guess from &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/vcs-prep-work-tearing-and-mocking-up-facebook-ux-and-design-part-1/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/vcs-prep-work-tearing-and-mocking-up-facebook-ux-and-design-part-2/&#34;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even looking around until I came across the blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://learntocodewith.me/&#34;&gt;LearnCodeWith.Me&lt;/a&gt; targeted at the beginner programmers. I signed up for it and had a quick email conversation with Laurence (founder of the blog).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
